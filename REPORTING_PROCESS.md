# Reporting Process

1. **Initial Response :** When a report is submitted, the project maintainers will acknowledge receipt of the report within 24 hours.

2. **Escalation Team :** The project maintainers will assign an Escalation Team member to investigate and address the reported issue.

3. **Investigation :** The Escalation Team member will review the details of the report, gather additional information if necessary (e.g., from witnesses or affected parties), and document their findings.

4. **Contact with Reporter :** The Escalation Team member will reach out to the reporter to confirm their understanding of the issue and seek any additional information that may be relevant to the investigation.

5. **Resolution :** Based on the evidence gathered, the Escalation Team will determine an appropriate course of action to address the reported behavior. This may include:

	- Addressing the issue through private channels (e.g., sending a reminder about our Code of Conduct).
	
	- Implementing temporary or permanent measures to prevent similar issues in the future.
	
	- Documenting the incident for posterity and reference.

6. **Follow-up :** The Escalation Team will follow up with all parties involved to ensure that the agreed-upon resolution has been implemented and to monitor any further developments.

## Reporting Mechanisms

1. **GitHub Issue :** We encourage contributors to submit reports using our dedicated GitHub issue template.

2. **Email :** Reporters can email the project maintainers directly at [email address].

3. **Private Messaging :** For sensitive or confidential matters, reporters may use private messaging channels (e.g., Discord direct message).

## Anonymity and Confidentiality

1. **Anonymous Reports :** We welcome anonymous reports, which will be reviewed with the utmost care to ensure confidentiality.

2. **Confidentiality Agreements :** In cases where a report involves sensitive information or confidential details, we may require the reporter to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before proceeding.

Investigation and Resolution : Typically within 7-10 business days, depending on the complexity of the issue.

2. **Follow-up :** Ongoing to ensure that agreed-upon resolutions are implemented and any further issues are addressed.

## Escalation Team
